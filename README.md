About
=====

This repository contains some [Katas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata "WTF is a Kata?"),
which should help you craft your programming skills by solving more or less complex problems.

Rules
=====

Each Kata has it's own subdirectory, containing unit tests in
cucumber or rspec, or both. Further subdirectories contain
some solutions (The quality of the solutions may differ and
you are welcome to provide better solutions and open a
pull request for them).

The only rule is: implementations MUST pass the tests to get
published. You can also improve the tests (find mistakes in the
current implementations) and submit them.
